## üîç How It Works

### Backend Flow

1. **File Upload** - User uploads resume through frontend
2. **Text Extraction** - Backend extracts text from PDF/DOC/TXT files using PyPDF2
3. **Perplexity API Call** - Sends resume text with structured prompt to Perplexity AI
4. **Response Processing** - Receives comprehensive analysis in structured format
5. **JSON Response** - Returns analysis to frontend

### Frontend Flow

1. **File Selection** - User selects resume file
2. **API Health Check** - Checks which AI service is available (Perplexity preferred)
3. **Upload & Analyze** - Sends file to backend via FormData
4. **Parse Response** - Parses Perplexity's structured text response
5. **Display Results** - Shows analysis in interactive UI tabs
6. **Save to Database** - Stores analysis for authenticated users

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Backend Won't Start

**Problem**: Port 8000 already in use

```
Solution:
netstat -ano | findstr :8000
taskkill /F /PID <PID>
```

**Problem**: Missing dependencies

```
Solution:
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Problem**: API key not found

```
Solution:
Check that backend/.env exists with PERPLEXITY_API_KEY
```

### Frontend Issues

**Problem**: "Perplexity API not configured"

```
Solution:
1. Check backend/.env has API key
2. Restart backend server
3. Check http://localhost:8000/ai/health shows perplexity.available: true
```

**Problem**: Analysis returns empty results

```
Solution:
1. Check resume file is valid PDF/TXT/DOC
2. Check backend logs for errors
3. Verify API key is valid and has credits
```

### API Issues

**Problem**: 503 Service Unavailable

```
Cause: Perplexity API not configured or backend not running
Solution: Start backend and verify API key
```

**Problem**: 500 Internal Server Error

```
Cause: Error during text extraction or API call
Solution: Check backend console logs for detailed error
```

## üìà Performance

- **Average Analysis Time**: 10-30 seconds
